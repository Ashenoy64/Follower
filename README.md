# Follower

Follower is a Python project that helps you identify the users on Instagram whom you follow, but they don't follow you back. It utilizes the `instaloader` module to fetch the necessary data from Instagram. The project includes two separate applications one built with Tkinter and another with Kivy for user interaction.

## Installation

To use the Follower project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from the GitHub repository or download the zip file and extract it:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ashenoy64/Follower.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

To run the Tkinter app:

```
python tkinter_app.py
```

This will launch the Tkinter application, where you can log in with your Instagram credentials and get the list of users who don't follow you back.

To run the Kivy app:

```
python kivy_app.py
```

The Kivy application provides a user-friendly interface to perform the same functionality as the Tkinter app.
